401-AWS: S3 and Lambda

## a description of how to use your lambda.
If you supply jpg to it, it will resize it.

## a description of any issues you encountered during deployment of this lambda.
All have been eventually solved. But these are the issues that I have faced
1. Was not able to see the logs
2. Didn't resize at the beginning
3. When installing dependencies - should give the name of your function name and Account ID and details
